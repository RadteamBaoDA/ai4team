## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start all services
./manage.sh up

# Start development environment
./manage.sh dev

# Start with monitoring
./manage.sh monitor
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start dev environment with hot reload
./manage.sh dev

# View logs in real-time
./manage.sh logs proxy

# Open shell for debugging
./manage.sh shell proxy

# Rebuild after major changes
./manage.sh build proxy
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Start production services
./manage.sh prod

# Monitor resource usage
./manage.sh status

# Update to latest version
./manage.sh update
```

## Configuration Highlights

### New Environment Variables Added

- `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=auto` - Automatic parallel request handling
- `OLLAMA_MAX_QUEUE=512` - Request queue management
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT=300` - Request timeout handling
- `ENABLE_QUEUE_STATS=true` - Queue monitoring
- `CACHE_MAX_SIZE=1000` - In-memory cache limits
- `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS=50` - Connection pooling
- Various Apple Silicon optimizations

### Volume Management

- **Config**: `../config/config.yaml` mounted read-only
- **Logs**: `../logs` for persistent logging
- **Models**: `../models` for local model storage
- **Cache**: Named volume for proxy cache data

### Health Checks

- Improved startup times with proper `start_period`
- Appropriate timeouts for each service
- Dependency management with health check conditions

## Backward Compatibility

All updates maintain backward compatibility:

- ✅ Existing `docker-compose up` commands continue to work
- ✅ Previous environment variables are still supported
- ✅ Default configurations remain the same
- ✅ Service names and ports unchanged

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Configuration**: Start with `./manage.sh up` to verify everything works
2. **Customize Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings
3. **Development Setup**: Use `./manage.sh dev` for development work
4. **Production Deployment**: Use appropriate production settings and security measures
5. **Monitoring**: Enable monitoring profile for production environments

## Migration Guide

If upgrading from previous Docker setup:

1. **Backup Data**: 
   ```bash
   ./manage.sh deep-clean  # Only if you want fresh start
   ```

2. **Update Config**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

3. **Rebuild Services**:
   ```bash
   ./manage.sh build
   ./manage.sh up
   ```

4. **Verify Operation**:
   ```bash
   ./manage.sh status
   ./manage.sh logs
   ```

The updated Docker configuration provides a robust, flexible, and production-ready deployment solution that scales from development to production environments while maintaining ease of use and comprehensive documentation.
