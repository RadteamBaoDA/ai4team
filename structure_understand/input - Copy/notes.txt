This is a simple text file for testing the text to PDF conversion feature.

The Document Converter now supports multiple file formats including:

- Microsoft Office documents (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
- OpenDocument formats (ODT, ODS, ODP)
- CSV files
- Text files (TXT, MD, RTF)
- HTML files
- And more!

Files that are already in PDF format or image files will be copied directly to the output folder, maintaining the same folder structure.

This makes it easy to process entire directories of mixed file types.

Thank you for using Document Converter v2.1!
