🗺️ Structure of a Filter Function: The Skeleton
Let's start with the simplest representation of a Filter Function. Don't worry if some parts feel technical at first—we’ll break it all down step by step!

🦴 Basic Skeleton of a Filter
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class Filter:
    # Valves: Configuration options for the filter
    class Valves(BaseModel):
        pass

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize valves (optional configuration for the Filter)
        self.valves = self.Valves()

    def inlet(self, body: dict) -> dict:
        # This is where you manipulate user inputs.
        print(f"inlet called: {body}")
        return body

    def stream(self, event: dict) -> dict:
        # This is where you modify streamed chunks of model output.
        print(f"stream event: {event}")
        return event

    def outlet(self, body: dict) -> None:
        # This is where you manipulate model outputs.
        print(f"outlet called: {body}")
